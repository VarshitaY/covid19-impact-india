### COVID Burden vs Hospital Capacity

This visual compares the total hospital bed availability with the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per state, calculating the average number of cases per hospital bed.

#### Key Observations:

- **Maharashtra** had the highest burden with **4.20 cases per bed** (7.97M cases, 231K beds).
- **Kerala** (3.49), **Karnataka** (2.09), and **Tamil Nadu** (1.83) also saw high hospital pressure.
- Smaller UTs like **Andaman & Nicobar**, **Lakshadweep**, and **Dadra & Nagar Haveli** showed very low average cases per bed (<0.01), suggesting better infrastructure sufficiency relative to case numbers.
- **Delhi**, **West Bengal**, and **Andhra Pradesh** also crossed the 1 case per bed mark, pointing to stressed health systems.

This metric gives a deeper look into how well-equipped different states were in handling patient load relative to their infrastructure.

### Top 10 States by Confirmed Cases

This visual highlights the ten most affected Indian states based on the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.

#### State-wise Case Distribution:

1. **Maharashtra** â€“ 7.97M  
2. **Kerala** â€“ 6.63M  
3. **Karnataka** â€“ 3.97M  
4. **Tamil Nadu** â€“ 3.47M  
5. **Andhra Pradesh** â€“ 2.32M  
6. **Uttar Pradesh** â€“ 2.09M  
7. **West Bengal** â€“ 2.03M  
8. **Delhi** â€“ 1.93M  
9. **Odisha** â€“ 1.29M  
10. **Rajasthan** â€“ 1.29M

The majority of these states have high population density or major urban hubs, which likely contributed to faster transmission and larger outbreaks.

### Top 10 States by Hospital Bed Capacity (Public + Private)

This visual compares the hospital infrastructure across states based on the total number of public and private beds, along with the average COVID-19 cases per bed.

#### Top States by Total Beds:

| State            | Total Beds | Public Beds | Private Beds | Cases Per Bed |
|------------------|------------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| Uttar Pradesh    | 281,402    | 76,260      | 205,142       | 7.43           |
| Karnataka        | 262,109    | 69,721      | 192,388       | 15.14          |
| Maharashtra      | 231,739    | 51,446      | 180,293       | 34.40          |

### Vaccination Trend Over Time (2021â€“2024)

This line chart presents the annual COVID-19 vaccination totals across India from 2021 to 2024.

| Year | Total Vaccinations (Approx.) |
|------|-------------------------------|
| 2021 | 1.74 Billion                  |
| 2022 | 6.98 Billion                  |
| 2023 | 7.68 Billion                  |
| 2024 | 4.59 Billion                  |

#### Key Observations:
- The campaign saw massive acceleration in 2022 and peaked in 2023.
- 2024 marked a decline in total vaccinations, suggesting saturation or strategic shift.
- The trend reflects India's large-scale mobilization toward pandemic recovery and immunity building.
